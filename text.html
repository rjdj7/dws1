		<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>

		<p>The giant squid (genus: <strong>Architeuthis</strong>) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family <em>Architeuthidae</em>, represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see <strong>Deep-sea gigantism</strong>): recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14 m (46 ft), one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft). Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.</p>

		<p>On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <em>NMNS (Museum of Nature and Science)</em> of Tokyo, Japan and the <em>OWA (Ogasawara Whale Watching Association)</em> took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The NMNS and OWA successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.</p>
